# Week 2 Assignment
## Tasks
- Plot the graph for X_test vs Y_test, and X_test vs Y_pred in the same plot for visualization. 
- Calculate the sum of root mean squared value (SSR) value for your model using for loop. (Bonus: Calculate R2_score)
- For the given dataset implement simple linear regression. Don't use the feature with non-numerical values.

### Hints
*	Use scatter command for plotting against y_test and plot command for plotting against y_pred from the matplotlib.pyplot library.
*	ssr = ∑(y_pred – y_test)^2 (summed over the test cases)
